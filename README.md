# Neo4j graphs (WIP)
The purpose of this project is to develop an environment to create you network devices as Nodes and use the Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the best path from source to destination.

This is a key problem we want to solve in order to create a solution to automate the creation of firewall rules. Additioanlly, the diagram will provide important information about the network devices by using metadata in the Node properties.
